# cs584-project

Here's how the program should act:

- Populate lists of search terms for individual words, short phrases, and long phrases
- Read all `*.txt` files from inside a user supplied folder (it can be hardcoded
  for laziness)
- Test search in each file for the phrases. Time each search individually.

## Getting Started

You need Haskell Stack

- `stack build`
- `stack exec -- cs584-project-exe --output output.html`
